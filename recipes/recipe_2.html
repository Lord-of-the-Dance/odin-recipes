            <p>I know, I know, this sounds like some healthy crap, right. Well it is. I put this entry in to appease the healthy crowd, since that's all the rage these days.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup ground flaxseed</li>
                <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 qt vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk the flour, flaxseed, baking powder, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until evenly blended; set aside. Beat the eggs and sugar together in a separate bowl; whisk the buttermilk and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil into the egg mixture. Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture until no lumps of flour remain and the dough is firm enough to handle. Cover the bowl and refrigerate at least 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough to 1/2-inch thickness on a generously-floured surface. Use a floured donut cutter to cut donut shapes out of the dough. Let the donuts stand for 5 to 10 minutes as the oil heats.</li>
                <li>Heat the frying oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Fry the donuts in the hot oil in batches until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
            </ol>
